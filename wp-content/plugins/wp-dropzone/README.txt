Upload files into WordPress media library from front-end.

== Description ==

Integrate Dropzone with your WordPress site. WP Dropzone will allow you to upload files into WordPress media library from any post/page. It comes with a large number of options and features.

### Features

### Usage Guideline

use ```[wp-dropzone]``` shortcode in your post/page to show upload area. You may also use ``` echo do_shortcode('[wp-dropzone]'); ``` in your template file.

The plugin comes with the following attributes:

* id: Assign an id to the uploader form. If empty an id will be generated automatically. ID should contain only letters(a-z, A-Z) and numbers(0-9). example: ```[wp-dropzone id="myID123"]```
* callback: Use native dropzone events. See [Dropzone Events](http://www.dropzonejs.com/#events) for details. example: ```[wp-dropzone callback="success: function(file, response) { console.log(file) }"]```
* title: Title of the uploader. example: ```[wp-dropzone title="Drop Files Here"]```
* desc: Description of the uploader. example: ```[wp-dropzone desc="Your file will be uploaded to media"]```
* border-width: Border width of the uploader area. Default '2'. example: ```[wp-dropzone border-width="2"]```
* border-style: Border style of the uploader area. Can be none, hidden, dotted, dashed, double, groove, ridge, inset, outset, initial, inherit. etc. Default 'solid'. example: ```[wp-dropzone border-style="dashed"]```

* margin-bottom: Add margin to bottom of the uploader. Default '0'. example: ```[wp-dropzone margin-bottom="10px"]```
* max-file-size: Limit maximum file size. Default value is based on your server settings(php.ini). example: ```[wp-dropzone max-file-size="2"] // set max file size to 2MB```
* remove-links: Add file remove/cancel button. Can be 'true' or 'false'. Default 'false'. ```[wp-dropzone remove-links="true"]```
* clickable: If set to true, the upload zone itself will be clickable, If false the upload zone will not be clickable, you have to drag file on the upload zone to upload file. Default value is 'true'. example: ```[wp-dropzone clickable="false"]```
* accepted-files: Specify the types of files that the uploader accepts. Some valid types are:  audio/*, video/*, image/*, or file extensions e.g.: .gif, .jpg, .png, .doc. example: ```[wp-dropzone accepted-files="image/*"] // only image files accepted```
* max-files: Define how many files are allowed to upload. example: ```[wp-dropzone max-files="1"] // only one file is allowed to uplaod```
